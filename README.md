# Dino-Scanning-System

# **Description**:

Development of a control interface for a microscope in the Dino Scanning System project. The interface automatically managed the image capture through the microscope and stored the photos in a local database, optimizing the process of data capture and organization. This automated system improved the efficiency of image collection and management.

# **Challenges and Solutions**:

A key challenge was automatically managing the microscope's proprietary system in parallel with the developed application. The solution involved creating a control interface that seamlessly integrated with the microscope’s software, allowing for automatic image capture and storage in the local database without manual intervention or disruptions to the microscope’s normal operation. This ensured smooth integration and an efficient, automated process.

# **Role and Responsibilities**:

Sole developer responsible for the design, implementation, and optimization of the control interface for the Dino Scanning System. The role involved automating image capture and storage in a local database, ensuring seamless integration with the microscope’s proprietary system for efficient parallel operation.
